# Simple Relay Chat Protocol

This repository contains a client and server implementation described by a chat
protocol that I designed for CS 494 Internetworking Protocols at Portland State
University. It's a simplified relay chat protocol where many clients connect to
one server and join rooms to discuss very important things.

As of 8 June 2018, The client and server implementations are mostly feature-
complete; however, an astute reader will note that room administration is not
supported by these basic implementations.

I am halting development on this project until:

* I've read and written more Rust code (and other network protocols) so that I
can criticize my implementation intelligently. Basically, I just need time to
reflect and learn from the mistakes I made on this project.

* I've had a chance to write my postmortem on it which will be published on my
blog.
